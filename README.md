This is my repo for STATS220. 

## A Little About Me:
 
- I am undertaking a degree in a BSc in Microbiology.
- I am taking STATS220 because I wanna be a problem for reviewer #2.  
- I am interested in learning about Statistics and Medical Microbiology -- utilising both disciplines in novel ways to interpret the (_micro_) natural world.
- I am a poet and a published undergrad student.

## How I Feel About University:
A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is: <br> 

>"These books have committed a great deal of injustice upon me, within them lies a _mystery_,<br>
a mystery that a dead mind may never comprehend, <br>
and because of that, it can never find joy in its conclusion, <br>
nor can it ever know peace" - **Jaun Alia** <br>
