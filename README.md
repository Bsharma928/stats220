# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in a BSc in Microbiology
- I am taking STATS 220 because I wanna be a problem for reviewer #2  
- I am interested in learning about Statistics and Medical Microbiology -- utilising both deciplines in novel ways to interpret the (micro) natural world.  

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://9gag.com/gag/aM8W5eM](https://tenor.com/view/kendrick-lamar-not-like-us-pi√±ata-owl-ovo-gif-18345010273510937572 )
